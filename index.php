      <h3>Why L&S:</h3>
      <p>"The Law & Society Minor, offered as an activity of the Program on Ethics & Public Life, provides an opportunity for focused study of the interaction between law and society from an interdisciplinary perspective predominantly rooted in the social sciences and humanities: anthropology, comparative literature, economics, government, history, philosophy, psychology, science and technology studies, and sociology. A large selection of courses and on-campus events is available for completing the minor. The benefits of a studentâ€™s participation depend on the particular courses and events selected, and the effort and interest invested."</p>
